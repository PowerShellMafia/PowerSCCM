Heavily based on [work by Brandon Helms](https://github.com/Cr0n1c/SCCM-Enumeration) that's described more [in this post](https://cr0n1c.wordpress.com/2016/01/27/using-Sccm-to-violate-best-practices/), as well as [SCCM POSH](http://www.snowland.se/powershell/sccm-posh/) by Rikard RÃ¶nnkvist.

More background information on using SCCM for DFIR is available on [@KeithTyler's](https://twitter.com/KeithTyler) blog post [on the subject](http://informationonsecurity.blogspot.com/2015/11/microsofts-accidental-enterprise-dfir.html) and in John McLeod/Mike Pilkington's ["Mining-for-Evil"](https://digital-forensics.sans.org/summit-archives/DFIR_Summit/Mining-for-Evil-John-McLeod-Mike-Pilkington.pdf) presentation.


## Usage

PowerSCCM will keep track of established SCCM database/WMI sessions, allowing you to reuse these
sessions with common queries. To establish a new session, use **New-SccmSession** along with the 
name of the computer with the SCCM database (**-ComputerName**) and the SCCM site database name
(**-DatabaseName**):

`New-SccmSession -ComputerName SCCM.testlab.local -DatabaseName CM_LOL`

This session is now stored in $Script:SCCMSessions and reusable by Get-SccmSession. To establish a session via WMI, use **-ConnectionType WMI**.

To find the available SCCM site codes on a server you have access to, use **Find-SccmSiteCode**:

`Find-SccmSiteCode -ComputerName SCCM.testlab.local`

To retrieve all current SCCM session objects, us **Get-SccmSession** with optional -Id, -Name, -ComputerName, -SiteCode, or -ConnectionType arguments. To close and remove a session, use **Remove-SccmSession** with any of the same arugments, or the -Session <PowerSCCM.Session> argument for a SCCM session object (passable on the pipeline).

`Get-SccmSession | Remove-SccmSession`

See the bottom of this README.md for offensive deployment.


## SCCM Database/Server Functions

Various functions that deal with querying/changing information concerning the SCCM database or server, as opposed to dealing with querying inventoried client information.

#### Find-LocalSccmInfo
Finds the site code and management point for a local system.

#### Find-SccmSiteCode
Finds SCCM site codes for a given server.

#### Get-SccmApplication
Returns information on user-deployed applications in an SCCM database.

#### Get-SccmPackage
Returns information on user-deployed packages in an SCCM database.

#### Get-SccmConfigurationItem
Returns SCCM configuration items in an SCCM database.

#### Set-SccmConfigurationItem
Sets a field to a particular value for a SCCM configuration keyed by CI_ID.

#### Get-SccmCollection
Returns SCCM collections that exist on the primary site server.

#### Get-SccmCollectionMember
Returns SCCM collection members.

## Get-Sccm*

Query functions require -Session <PowerSCCM.Session> (passable on the pipeline):

`Get-SccmSession | Get-SccmRecentlyUsedApplication | Export-CSV -NoTypeInformation recent_apps.csv`

`Get-SccmRecentlyUsedApplication -Session $Session | Export-CSV -NoTypeInformation recent_apps.csv`

All of these functions also share a common set of optional parameters:

* **-Newest <X>** - return only the X newest entries from the database.
* **-OrderBy <FIELD>** - order the results by a particular field.
* **-Descending** - if -OrderBy is set, display results in descending order.
* **-ComputerNameFilter <COMPUTER>** - only return results for a particular computer name.
* **-TimeStampFilter <TIMESTAMP>** - the SCCM collection timestamp to filter on, accepts <> operators.

Each function also has a set of custom -XFilter parameters that allow for query filtering on specific field names/values.

Returns information on the current set of running services as of the last SCCM agent query/checkin.

#### Get-SccmServiceHistory
Returns information on the historical set of running services as of the last SCCM agent query/checkin.

#### Get-SccmConsoleUsage
Returns historical information on user console usage as of the last SCCM agent query/checkin.

#### Get-SccmSoftwareFile
Returns information on inventoried non-Microsoft software files. **This option is not enabled by default in SCCM**- we recommend setting SCCM to inventory all *.exe files on hosts.

#### Get-SccmBrowserHelperObject
Returns information on discovered browser helper objects. **This option is not enabled by default in SCCM**.

#### Get-SccmShare
Returns information on discovered shares.**This option is not enabled by default in SCCM**.

#### Get-SccmPrimaryUser
Returns user/machine pairings where the user is set as a 'Primary User' through SCCM.


## Find-Sccm*

Meta-functions that use the Get-Sccm* query functions to find common 'bad' things. All of these functions -Session <PowerSCCM.Session> (passable on the pipeline).

#### Find-SccmRenamedCMD
Finds renamed cmd.exe executables using Get-SccmRecentlyUsedApplication and appropriate filters.

#### Find-SccmUnusualEXE
Finds recently launched applications that don't end in *.exe using Get-SccmRecentlyUsedApplication and appropriate filters.

#### Find-SccmRareApplication
Finds the rarest -Limit <X> recently launched applications that don't end in *.exe using Get-SccmRecentlyUsedApplication and appropriate filters.

#### Find-SccmPostExploitation
Finds recently launched applications commonly used in post-exploitation.

#### Find-SccmPostExploitationFile

## Offensive Deployment

It takes a few steps to deploy malicious packages/scripts to clients through SCCM, and offensive manipulation/deployment is only currently supported through WMI SCCM sessions. SCCM deployments need three parts- a user/device collection of targets, a malicious application to deploy, and a deployment that binds the two together. 

To create a collection to place targets in, use **New-SccmCollection**, along with the -CollectionName and -CollectionType ('Device' or 'User') parameters. You then need to add targets to the collection, either with **Add-SccmDeviceToCollection** or **Add-SccmUserToCollection** depending on the collection type.

Once the target collection is completed, create a new malicious application with **New-SccmApplication**. You need to specify an -ApplicationName, and then can choose to deploy a -UNCProgram (for a hosted binary payload), -PowerShellScript (for the text of a PowerShell script to deploy), -PowerShellB64 (for an ASCII base64-encoded PowerShell blob), or -PowerShellUnicodeB64 (for an UNICODE base64-encoded PowerShell blob). The targeted payload will be created and pushed to a custom WMI class on the SCCM server using Push-WmiPayload, universal read permissions will be granted with Grant-WmiNameSpaceRead, and the application will be created and marked as 'Hidden' in the main SCCM GUI.

Finally, you can deploy a newly created application to a given collection with **New-SccmApplicationDeployment**, specifying the -ApplicationName and -CollectionName respectively, as well as a -AssignmentName to name the deployment. Once the SCCM agents check back in your malicious application should deploy.

## Offensive Cleanup

Cleanup functions exist for all offensive actions.

To remove an application deployment, use **Remove-SccmApplicationDeployment**.

To enumerate the current collections use Get-SccmCollection, and to remove a collection created by New-SccmCollection, use **Remove-SccmCollection**.

To enumerate the current applications use Get-SccmApplication, and to remove a collection created by New-SccmApplication, use **Remove-SccmApplication**. This also calls **Remove-WmiPayload** to remove the pushed WMI payload, and to revokes the namespace read with **Revoke-WmiNameSpaceRead**.
